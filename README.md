Assessment regulations
Refer to section 4 of the “How you study” guide for undergraduate students for a clarification of how you are assessed, penalties and late submissions, what constitutes plagiarism etc.
https://www.westminster.ac.uk/sites/default/public-files/general-documents/Handbook_of_Academic_Regulations_2023_V2.pdf   
Penalty for Late Submission
If you submit your coursework late but within 24 hours or one working day of the specified deadline, 10 marks will be deducted from the final mark, as a penalty for late submission, except for work which obtains a mark in the range 40 – 49%, in which case the mark will be capped at the pass mark (40%). If you submit your coursework more than 24 hours or more than one working day after the specified deadline you will be given a mark of zero for the work in question unless a claim of Mitigating Circumstances has been submitted and accepted as valid. 
It is recognised that on occasion, illness or a personal crisis can mean that you fail to submit a piece of work on time. In such cases you must inform. the Campus Office in writing on a mitigating circumstances form, giving the reason for your late or non-submission. You must provide relevant documentary evidence with the form. This information will be reported to the relevant Assessment Board that will decide whether the mark of zero shall stand.

Coursework Description
The coursework rationale is to introduce the students to the practical nature of 3D interactive media development. It realizes the above by setting two pieces of coursework that assess student knowledge and understanding in different aspects of composing a 3D interactive media product:
Coursework 2 Description
Assesses the student practical ability to use appropriate scripting language to
create required animation and interactivity to a proposed 3D interactive media product. In
addition, it assesses the student’s skills documenting their implementation in a report using a professional style. and their entrepreneurial skills by the creation of a working video demo of their
project.
Padlet: https://uowdigital.padlet.org/fergusj/3DIMD_CWSamples   
Schedule: Schedule 3DIMD 2024.docx
IMP: Interactive Media Product
Groups: Each group will be represented by different students in weeks 10, 11    and 12 to present progress on CW2, in second half of lecture or tutorial as time permits. Peer review will occur between lectures and is based on padlet review of video blogs.
Artificial Intelligence Content: You are not expected to use AI to assist you in your project. 
If you chose to use it, you should adhere to the following university guidelines: https://www.westminster.ac.uk/current-students/studies/study-skills-and-training/guidance-for-students-on-using-generative-ai   
You should demonstrate understanding of coding, and only use AI to better this understanding, if used at all. Currently all major companies will not allow general AI use, due to copyright issues, so this is in line with industry.
-   For code assist or asset generation by AI, you are to fully reference the work in your individual report and also in comments in the project code. If you choose to use AI to assist with code, make sure it is for understanding code better, or to support debugging enhanced work, Not for the tutorial work that is handed in as part of the CW submission, and not for writing sections of code. 
-   Image or video AI can be referenced as normal, and can be used throughout the project, but does not receive as much marks as original work, unless it is used well or in an innovative way.
-   AI for writing reports is not allowed, and any use to assist research should follow the guidance above.
-   At all times, please do consult the Module Leader for acceptable AI use.
-   Misuse of AI can result in 0 marks or an Assessment Offense.
Coursework Elements
1.   Group Interactive Media Product Unity Project File and Video (1 per group)      a.   Group Unity Project file with all Visual Studio code and assets included
